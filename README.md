# ESRtool

Port of the PS2 Homebrew tool [esr-disc-patcher-cli](https://github.com/ali-raheem/esrtool). Based on [Tatsh's original work posted on PSX-Scene](https://web.archive.org/web/20150919031500/http://psx-scene.com/forums/f164/esr-disc-patcher-linux-mac-qt4-port-60096/).

These older versions contain several bugs, at least one of which is potentially exploitable. This tool is safer in that regard at least.
